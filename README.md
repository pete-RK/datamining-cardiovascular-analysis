# Project Overview:
The Cardiovascular Data Mining project focuses on leveraging advanced data mining techniques to analyze cardiovascular health data to predict spikes in insulin levels. Insulin spikes can indicate various underlying health conditions such as insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes, or metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Key Objectives:

    Data Collection and Preparation: Gather a comprehensive dataset comprising various cardiovascular health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, physical activity, dietary habits, and genetic factors. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

    Feature Selection and Engineering: Identify relevant features that may contribute to insulin level spikes and perform feature engineering to create or transform new variables. This may involve statistical analysis, domain expertise, and correlation studies.

    Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or deep learning techniques like neural networks. Train the models on historical data to predict the likelihood of insulin level spikes in future instances.

    Evaluation and Validation: Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Validated the models using cross-validation techniques and assessed their generalization capabilities.

    Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the predictive analysis results to understand the factors contributing to insulin level spikes. Generate actionable insights and recommendations for individuals to manage their cardiovascular health and mitigate the risk of insulin resistance and related conditions.
